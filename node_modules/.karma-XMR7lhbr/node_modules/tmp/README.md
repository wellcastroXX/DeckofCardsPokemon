## About

This is a [widely used library][2] to create temporary files and directories
in a [node.js][1] environment.

Tmp offers both an asynchronous and a synchronous API. For all API calls, all
the parameters are optional. There also exists a promisified version of the
API, see [tmp-promise][5].

Tmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates,
a six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that much
entropy left on your system, Tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.

You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or
not.

If you do not want to store your temporary directories and files in the
standard OS temporary directory, then you are free to override that as well.

## An Important Note on Previously Undocumented Breaking Changes

All breaking changes that had been introduced, i.e.

- tmpdir must be located under the system defined tmpdir root.
- Spaces being collapsed into single spaces
- Removal of all single and double quote characters

have been reverted in v0.2.2 and tmp should now behave as it did before the
introduction of these breaking changes.

Other breaking changes, i.e.

- template must be relative to tmpdir
- name must be relative to tmpdir
- dir option must be relative to tmpdir

are still in place.

In order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly
introduced tmpdir option.

## An Important Note on Compatibility

See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

### Version 0.2.3

- Node version <= 14.4 has been dropped.
- rimraf has been dropped from the dependencies

### Version 0.2.2

Since version 0.2.2, all support for node version <= 14 has been dropped.

### Version 0.1.0

Since version 0.1.0, all support for node versions < 0.10.0 has been dropped.

Most importantly, any support for earlier versions of node-tmp was also dropped.

If you still require node versions < 0.10.0, then you must limit your node-tmp
dependency to versions below 0.1.0.

### Version 0.0.33

Since version 0.0.33
